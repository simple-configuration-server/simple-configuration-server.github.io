1. A config directory, containing the files/templates that should be served
2. A common directory, containing yaml files with common configuration elements
   (Can be empty)

   configuration files (Optional)
4. scs-users.yaml, containing SCS user definitions (Optional; Only if the
   built-in auth module is used)
