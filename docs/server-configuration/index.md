# Server Configuration
To serve your configuration files/variables using SCS you need:

1. The scs-configuration.yaml file, containing the settings of SCS
2. A config directory, containing the files/templates that should be served
3. A common directory, containing yaml files with common configuration elements
   (Can be empty)
4. A secrets directory, containing secrets, such as passwords, used in
   configuration files (Optional)
5. scs-users.yaml, containing SCS user definitions (Optional; Only if the
   built-in auth module is used)
