# Log Centralization

{: .note}
The below serves as an example. Update the files so the settings match your
deployment, and conder using CI/CD and a container registry to build, version
and distribute the Docker image for your deployment

The official SCS repository contains
[an example configuration](https://github.com/simple-configuration-server/simple-configuration-server/tree/master/examples/filebeat) for using an Elastic Filebeat Docker container to
centralize the logs generated by the SCS.

Use the [Docker file](https://github.com/simple-configuration-server/simple-configuration-server/blob/master/examples/filebeat/dockerfile)
to build a Docker image based on the official Filebeat Docker image, that
includes the following additional configuration for centralizing SCS logs:
* A custom 'scs' Filebeat module
* An extended fields.yaml file, with additional fields for SCS logs

Inside the [fields.APPEND.yml](https://github.com/simple-configuration-server/simple-configuration-server/blob/master/examples/filebeat/fields.APPEND.yml)
file, you can see the additional fields that are used to store SCS log data in
ElasticSearch. Change the ['scs' module configuration file](https://github.com/simple-configuration-server/simple-configuration-server/blob/master/examples/filebeat/modules.d/scs.yml)
of the example to disable/enable the centralization of each type of logs, and
change the log file paths.

To built the image, clone the repository locally, and run the following inside
the 'examples/filebeat' directory:
```bash
docker build . -t filebeat-scs
```

To use the built image, add a service to the Docker compose-file of your SCS
deployment, for example:
```yaml
filebeat:
    image: filebeat-scs
    environment:
      # See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.2/running-on-docker.html
      # for more configuration options
      - output.elasticsearch.hosts=${ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS:?error}
    volumes:
      # The logs are shared between the containers using a Docker volume
      - scs-logs:/var/log/scs
```
