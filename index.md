# Simple Configuration Server (SCS)

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
A Server for hosting configuration files and variables that's designed to
be simple do deploy and use

With SCS, you can host directories with configuration files and variables
directly over HTTP(S), like any other file-server. Unlike simple file-servers
however, SCS offers the following:

* **Jinja2 Templates**: In addition to hosting simple files, templates allow
  you to dynamically render configuration files/variables. Thereby adding the
  ability to define variables used accross multiple endpoints centrally, and
  reference them in multiple configuration file templates.
* **Seperation of Secrets**: Using the `!scs-secret` YAML-tag you can reference
  secrets stored in a seperate location. In combination with the templating
  system you can completely seperate your configuration from secrets. This
  allows you to securely _version-control your configuration using Git_.
* **POST requests with template variables**: Clients can send one or more
  template variables via POST requests, to include server-specific configuration
  parameters in returned configuraiton files, such as path to specific
  directories on machines.
* **Simple User Authentication**: The built-in user authentication system
  uses a simple file-based configuration, but allows fine-grained control over
  the urls users can access, and the IP-addresses/Subnets they can access them
  from.
* **Extendability**: At it's core, SCS is already a powerfull system, but
  inside the 'scs-configuration.yaml' file you can further configure:
    1. A custom Flask blueprint to use for authentication, instead of the
       system mentioned above
    2. Additional YAML tag constructors
    3. Additional Flask blueprints
    4. Additional template extensions for Jinja2
